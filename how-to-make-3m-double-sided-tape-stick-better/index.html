<meta name="description" content="Awasome How To Make 3M Double Sided Tape Stick Better 2022, Transfer tape consists of a single layer of adhesive without any backing. Hey guys, i�ve been trying all day to get the 3m double sided tape to stick to the trd fender flare, i have the auth trd flares ( if that matters ) in urethane, i stuck 3 just fine and put them on the car, but just that 1 won�t even hold the tape to the rear of the flare.
Scotch® Double Sided Tape 136NA Walmart Canada From walmart.ca
I was having some problems getting the first layer to stick nicely to the blue tape. 3m vhb double sided tape is much more durable, being able to on average take on freezing temperatures of 0 degrees celcius or 32 degrees fahrenheit. Rubbing alcohol if the surface is greasy, you will need a stronger solution like the 3m citrus base cleaner to cut the oil. I am using 3m double sided tape for both my front and rear dashcams for a long time without any issue.
