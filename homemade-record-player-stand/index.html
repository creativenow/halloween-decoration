Pin on Homemade speaker stands From pinterest.com
I was on the hunt for a couple months for the perfect stand to compliment it. The main disadvantage of purchasing a new record player stand is that it won’t be cheap. To cut all the boards to the proper dimensions and assemble the cabinet, tom used a variety of tools, including a domino joiner, a kapex ks120 sliding compound miter saw and a ts 55 circular saw, which are all. Next, i had to cut them down to the surface of the top of the piece and sand that area smooth for finishing.
