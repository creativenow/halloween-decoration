To create a custom texture for a sims 4 item, you need to change the original texture into a dds file, edit it in gimp, replace the original texture with your edited version, then turn it back into a package file for use in the game again.

Work clothing can be a huge problem in sims 4, but using cheat codes and mods is a great way to solve it.
