Amazon joined Goodwill for a great way to reuse old From businessinsider.com
I just started printing my own shipping labels but i wondering if anybody has any suggestions on if i should tape the whole label on the box with tape covering it? The label should be affixed to your package with a clear plastic address pouch, which you can obtain from a staffed ups service centre, or by selecting the shipping tab in the area at the top of the screen, then selecting get ups labels, paks and more in the area at the left. Use clear packaging tape do not cover the barcodes make sure there are no loose edges which could get caught during transportation Cover the entire scrap of paper so that your label won�t tear or get wet.
